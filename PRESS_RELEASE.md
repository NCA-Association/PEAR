## üòû The Problem

<!-- content goes below -->

Across NYC, low-income children often participate in extracurricular activities and enrichment programs at a significantly lower rate than higher-income families. This is distressing as these programs are often linked to positive education and socio-emotional outcomes and support long-term development.

## üìù Summary

<!-- content goes below -->

New York City is home to a diverse array of programs and activities designed to support the development, education, and well-being of its young residents. However, many low-income families struggle to navigate the fragmented landscape of children's programs, making it challenging to find and enroll in opportunities that best suit their needs (source. [NY Daily News](https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/03/23/parents-kids-missing-out-due-to-lack-of-awareness-about-subsidized-child-care-programs-in-nyc-report/#)). This lack of accessibility and transparency disproportionately impacts low-income and underserved communities, exacerbating existing inequalities in access to quality programs.

## ü§î Our Hypothesis

<!-- content goes below -->

If families in New York City have access to a centralized platform that connects them with organizations offering programs for their children and allows them to read and write reviews about these programs, then we think that parents will be able to enroll their kids in fun extracurricular activities when they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have!

Our product, PEAR, aims to address these issues by creating a centralized, user-friendly platform that provides borough-specific multilingual information to help low-income parents residing within NYC access free resources for their children in New York City.

- Make more informed decisions about enrolling their children in programs that suit their needs and preferences, leading to increased participation and satisfaction.
- Hold organizations accountable for the quality of their programs by providing detailed feedback and ratings, which will encourage organizations to maintain high standards and address any issues promptly.
- Create a community-driven knowledge base of program experiences and insights, which will help other families navigate the landscape of children's programs in NYC more effectively.

By empowering families with the tools to discover, compare, and review children's programs, our application aims to enhance the overall quality and accessibility of these programs, ultimately contributing to better developmental outcomes and experiences for children in New York City.
