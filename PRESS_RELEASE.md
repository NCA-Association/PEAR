## 😞 The Problem

<!-- content goes below -->

Across NYC, low-income children often participate in extracurricular activities and enrichment programs at a significantly lower rate than higher-income families. This is distressing as these programs are often linked to positive education and socio-emotional outcomes and support long-term development.

## 📝 Summary

<!-- content goes below -->

New York City is home to a diverse array of programs and activities designed to support the development, education, and well-being of its young residents. However, many low-income families struggle to navigate the fragmented landscape of children's programs, making it challenging to find and enroll in opportunities that best suit their needs (source. [NY Daily News](https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/03/23/parents-kids-missing-out-due-to-lack-of-awareness-about-subsidized-child-care-programs-in-nyc-report/#)). This lack of accessibility and transparency disproportionately impacts low-income and underserved communities, exacerbating existing inequalities in access to quality programs.

## 🤔 Our Hypothesis

<!-- content goes below -->

If families in New York City have access to a centralized platform that connects them with organizations offering programs for their children and allows them to read and write reviews about these programs, then we think that parents will be able to enroll their kids in fun extracurricular activities when they otherwise wouldn’t have!
